1. Implement search 
	- by substring(find author/title/both)
	- by tuple -> (title, author), (title_substring, author_substring)
	- display results -> sort by most relevent 
		-> redirect to the single book context
2. Single book context:
	- details (title, author, genre, overall rating)
	- list of text fileds:
		 + all comments and ratings
		 + add a new comment 
		 + add rating
	- maybe picture/cover someday
3. Author context: 
	-list of books -> redirect to the single book context
4. Genre context - same
5. Explore page 
	- display top books by author, genre, rating (soo, buttons to choose criteria) // also on index page
	- recommended for you + nice alg
6. User profile page (My bookshelf) - some enhancements(smaller fields, add book fields under the list)
    - DELETE book
